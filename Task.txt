Back-end developer task
Create an ASP.NET WebAPI (4 or Core) back-end web service for providing news streams from different
sources. Service should function like Feedly service (https://feedly.com/).
Service should allow clients to manage feed collections, and to access all news items in those collections.
Service should extensively cache data to minimize external requests. As a start, use RSS or Atom feeds,
but architecture should be extensible to support adding new types of feed sources in the future (3rd
party services, web scraping, etc).
Service should return data in its own format, you should create custom models for all data types, not
just redirect XML feeds to the clients.
This should be a headless Web API REST service, no UI is necessary.
Necessary functions:
• Create a new collection (returns collection Id)
• Add feed to a collection
• Get all news for a collection
• Caching of feed data
• A simple (console or GUI) test application to show API interaction
Plus will be:
• C#/.net client SDK
• Authentication
• Persistence
• Logging
• Tests
Projects will be tested on latest Visual Studio 2017 Community/Pro with Core and Web tools installed.
